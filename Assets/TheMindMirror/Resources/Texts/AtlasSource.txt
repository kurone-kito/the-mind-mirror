更新履歴::CHANGELOG --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ◆ 2022.12.14 v1.6.1 ALPHA マインドライターのフォームに挟まって事故死する、黒音キトという間抜けなにゃんにゃんがいたため、フォームの表示位置を変更してハマらないよう対策しました。 ◆ 2022.12.14 v1.6.0 ALPHA また手狭になってきましたので、思い切ってさらに 2 部屋追加しました！ 性格を映す鏡のうち、2 基は別室へ移動しました。(将来的には 4 基に削減予定) 現在は単なるフリールームですが、将来的に相性透視のお部屋として利用する予定です。 ◆ 2022.12.12 v1.5.0 ALPHA 診断結果に外面や集中時の性格、そして人生観の解説を追加しました。これにより結果の組み合わせ爆発が生じ、12 通りから 17,280 通りに増えました！ ローカライズを進めました。全体的な翻訳率は 75% 程度になりました！ ◆ 2022.12.10 v1.4.0 ALPHA 診断結果をさらに詳細化、各性格の弱点・攻略法を追加しました。ぜひ自分自身だけでなく、好きな異性や苦手な上司などの性格を調べてみてください！ マインドライターについて、説明文の UI が少し詰まって見えたため、位置調整をしました。 ページネーション時や言語切り替え時のカクつきを改善しました。 ◆ 2022.12.10 v1.3.1 ALPHA 性格を映す鏡について、ページネーション操作後にマインドキューブを返却＆再挿入すると、クラッシュしてページネーションが操作不能となる不具合を修正しました。 診断結果全一覧のプレビューテスト UI がクラッシュして、事実上の置物 UI と化す不具合を修正しました。 ◆ 2022.12.9 v1.3.0 ALPHA 診断結果をより強化しました！これにより結果は 3 通りから 12 通りに増えました！ 今後数万通りもの組み合わせが生まれる予定です。 また既存の結果についても、フォントサイズを調整して見やすくしました。 多言語対応を強化しました。全体的な翻訳率は 70% 程度になりました！ PC スペックによって、言語切り替え時に発生するカクつきを少しだけ滑らかにしました。 診断結果のプレビューテスト用に、隠し UI を追加しました。あまりホンキで隠していないため、きっとすぐに見つかるでしょう！ ◆ 2022.12.8 v1.2.0 ALPHA 診断結果の多言語対応を実装しました。全体的な翻訳率は 65% 程度になりました！ また、日本語の表示結果もフォントサイズを調整して見やすくしました。 ◆ 2022.12.7 v1.1.0 ALPHA 言語切り替え機能を追加しました。まだ翻訳率は 4% と低いですが、今後のアップデートで翻訳率を上げていきます。 マインドライターに消去機能を追加しました。自分の性格情報が刻まれたキューブを残したままワールドを去るのは、ちょっと後ろめたいと思う方も安心です！ マインドキューブが初期化されているかわかりにくいため、初期状態のマインドキューブの色を変更しました。 ◆ 2022.12.4 v1.0.0 ALPHA ▶祝！このバージョンをもって Community Labs 入りしました！◀ 性格を映す鏡の日本語解説を追加しました！今後もっと解説を拡充します！ 解説を実装しましたので、暫定版のパラメーター表示機能は削除しました。 マインドキューブを手に取った時、手に吸い付くように実装しました。サイコキネシスとどちらが良いか迷いましたが、手についたほうが自然と判断しました。 性格を映す鏡に挿入したマインドキューブを他人が返却すると、キューブが暴れて手に負えなくなる不具合を修正しました。 ◆ 2022.12.2 v0.9.0 Pre-ALPHA 性格を映す鏡へ暫定版マインドビューアーの機能を統合し、暫定版は廃止しました。日本語による解説の実装まで、あともう少しだけお待ちください！ ◆ 2022.11.30 v0.8.0 Pre-ALPHA お部屋の動線が若干不自然なため、配置替えおよび順路サインの配置をしました。これで迷子の迷子の子猫ちゃんも迷わないでしょう！ 性格を映す鏡へマインドキューブに刻まれたお名前を転送する機能、および空のマインドキューブを挿入した際の警告文言を追加しました。 まだ簡易版ビューアよりも機能が少ないですが、今後のバージョンアップにご期待ください！ ◆ 2022.11.27 v0.7.0 Pre-ALPHA 性格を映す鏡に長文を入れるために、UI や挙動を少しだけ改良しました。今後長文が入るためにもう少しだけ改良が必要です！ 性格を映す鏡を 2 台増設し、いつもハブられるのび太でも一緒に性格診断ができるようになりました！ マインドライターなどのマインドキューブを挿入できるオブジェクトについて、挿入中はパーティクルを無効化し、キラキラで入力中に気が散らないようにしました。 マインドキューブの横のカラーの誤認防止のため、左右を識別する模様を付けました。 マインドキューブの簡易ビューアを性格を映す鏡の部屋に移動し、元の場所には今後のアップデート計画を掲示しました。 マインドキューブをライターなどに挿入した際、強制的に手放すようにして、返却時に所定の場所から出てこなくてパニックにならないよう対処しました。 ◆ 2022.11.25 v0.6.0 Pre-ALPHA 性格を映す鏡のモックアップを追加しました。まだ制作中のため、当面は暫定版をご利用ください。 ◆ 2022.11.24 v0.5.1 Pre-ALPHA 誰かがマインドキューブをライターなどに挿入した際、他人から見るとキューブが消えずにとどまり続け、横取り泥棒猫が発生してしまうこともある不具合を修正しました。 ◆ 2022.11.23 v0.5.0 Pre-ALPHA 物が増えてきてやや手狭となってきたため、新たな部屋を増築しました。これでチャンバラもやりやすくなったでしょう！ 性格診断エンジン『Dantalion』を搭載しました！生年月日を入力すると、四柱推命に基づいた性格診断が行えます！ ライターで書き込んだ後のマインドキューブをよく見ましょう。色が同じ人は、性格もきっと似ているはずです！ マインドキューブの情報を見るための簡易ビューアを追加しました。解説については、後日追加予定です。 マインドライターにマインドキューブを剛速球で投げつけると、排出時にマインドキューブが暴走して手の付けようがなくなる不具合を修正しました。でももう少し優しく扱ってね！ マインドライターの名前入力で、数値を入力できないバグを修正しました。数字は VRChat ではありふれた名前であることを失念していました！ ◆ 2022.11.20 v0.4.0 Pre-ALPHA マインドキューブに魂の情報を書き込む、マインドライターを設置しました。ぜひあなたのサイン入りマインドキューブを作ってみてください！ 現在のバージョンでは、生年月日はマインドキューブ色付けにおける『乱数の種』としてのみ使用していますが、今後のアップデートで、性格の色を導き出すでしょう。 マインドキューブはグローバルオブジェクトになり、だいぶゴツゴツした見た目になりました！これで相手を殴れば、きっと相手も痛がってくれるでしょう！ その一方で、残念なお知らせもあります。マインドキューブはワールドに 15 個のみとなり、無限生成はできなくなりました。残念！ ◆ 2022.11.18 v0.3.0 Pre-ALPHA 光源を調整して、少しだけリッチになりました！特に Quest 勢の皆様は壁が真っ黒になる現象が改善したことでしょう！ CHANGELOG ビューアが少し反抗的でしたので、調教しておきました。この更新で最後の行まで読むのが、少しだけ楽になりました。 マインドキューブを投げすぎると、稀に壁を貫通して紛失する現象がありましたが、そのような失せ物が部屋の中央で見つかるよう実装しました。 ◆ 2022.11.13 v0.2.0 Pre-ALPHA モックアップだったトグルスイッチに魂が宿り、鏡のオンオフに対応しました。鏡から一定距離離れると、トグルスイッチは一時的に眠るでしょう。 マインドキューブ生成装置を追加しました。現状これはマインドキューブのモックアップを量産できるだけですが、これで積み木遊びやチャンバラをお楽しみください！ 足元に物落下防止のための床判定を追加。 CHANGELOG、およびワールドの紹介文言の追加。 ◆ 2022.11.10 v0.1.0 Pre-ALPHA 初版。シンプルな小部屋と、固定常設鏡で構成されたワールド。 トグルスイッチがありますが、壊れるまでオンオフしても何も起きません。 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 最後まで読んでくれた物好きな貴方は、たとえ今日初めて訪れたとしても、きっと胸を張って最古参になれるでしょう！
